# A method is a function that is called on a particular value


>>> spam = ['hello', 'hi', 'howdy', 'heyas']
>>> spam.index('hello')
0

1. You can't call a method by itself. AKA index('hello') doesn't do anything because it doesn't reference spam
 
  
Methods for lists:
   Index figures out where in the list the value is stored. i.e. spam.index('hi') will return 1.
