Table 2-1. Comparison Operators

Operator        Meaning

==              Equal to
!=              Not equal to
<               Less than
>               Greater than
<=              Less than or equal to
>=              Greater than or equal to


Works for strings as well:

'hello' == 'hello' returns True

'dog' == 'cat' returns False
'dog' != 'cat' returns True

The only operators that work with strings are == and !=. <, >, <= and >= don't work with strings. 


*** Important detail - an integer or floating point will never match a string. 

42 == '42' returns False. 




    The == operator (equal to) asks whether two values are the same as each other.

    The = operator (assignment) puts the value on the right into the variable on the left.
