There are three rules for blocks:

    Blocks begin when the indentation increases.

    Blocks can contain other blocks.

    Blocks end when the indentation decreases to zero or to a containing blockâ€™s indentation.


name = 'Mary'
password = 'swordfish'
if name == 'Mary':
    print('Hello Mary')
    if password == 'swordfish':
        print('Access granted.')
    else:
        print('Wrong password.')
